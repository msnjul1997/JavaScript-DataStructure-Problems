					Objects and Classes
				</header>
				<p><b>Object : </b>An Object is an istance of class.
                    It is a Real-word entity & Run-Time entity and 
                    it is entity which has State and Behaviour.
					<br>
					<b>Class : </b>It is a collection of Object and 
                    it doesnt take any space in memory and it cann't be
                    physical. And Class is called as a BluePrint and Logical
                    Entity.

					Inheritance

				<p>
					Used For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved). &
                    For Code Reusability.
                    class Subclass-name extends Superclass-name  
                    {  
                        //methods and fields  
                    }  

				</p>

					<b>Mode of Inheritance : </b><br><br>

					<b>Public Mode : </b>If we derive a sub
					class from a public base class. Then the
					public member of the base class will
					become public in the derived class and
					protected members of the base class
					will become protected in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Protected Mode : </b>If we derive a
					sub class from a Protected base class.
					Then both public member and protected
					members of the base class will become
					protected in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Private Mode : </b>If we derive a
					sub class from a Private base class.
					Then both public member and protected
					members of the base class will become
					Private in derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Types of Inheritance in Java : </b>
					<br><br><br>
					<b>Single Inheritance :</b> In single
					inheritance, a class is allowed to inherit
					from only one class. i.e. one sub class
					is inherited by one base class only.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multiple Inheritance :</b> Multiple
					Inheritance is a feature of Java where a
					class can inherit from more than one
					classes. i.e one sub class is inherited
					from more than one base classes.
					<br><br>
					<b>Multilevel Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, a derived class is
					created from another derived class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hieratical Inheritance :</b> In this
					type of inheritance, more than one sub
					class is inherited from a single base
					class i.e. more than one derived class
					is created from a single base class.
					<br><br>
					<b>Hybrid (Virtual) Inheritance :</b>
					Hybrid Inheritance is implemented by
					combining more than one type of
					inheritance.
					For example: Combining Hierarchical
					inheritance and Multiple Inheritance.

					Polymorphism
				</header>
				<p>
					The word polymorphism means having many
					forms. In simple words, we can define
					polymorphism as the ability of a message
					to be displayed in more than one form.
					A real-life example of polymorphism, a
					person at the same time can have
					different characteristics.
					Like a man at the same time is a father,
					a husband, an employee. So the same
					person posses different behavior in
					different situations. This is called
					polymorphism. Polymorphism is considered
					as one of the important features of Object
					Oriented Programming.
					<br>
					
					<br> 1. Compile time Polymorphism<br>
					2. Runtime Polymorphism
				</p>

				<p>Compile time polymorphism: This type of
					polymorphism is achieved by function
					overloading or operator overloading.
					<br> Runtime polymorphism: This type
					of polymorphism is achieved by
					Function Overriding.
				</p>

					Abstraction
				</header>

				<p>
					Data abstraction is one of the most
					essential and important feature of object
					oriented programming in Java. Abstraction
					means displaying only essential information
					and hiding the details. Data abstraction
					refers to providing only essential information
					about the data to the outside world,
					hiding the background details or implementation.
					<br> 
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Abstraction using Classes:</b> We can
					implement Abstraction in Java using classes.
					Class helps us to group data members and member
					functions using available access specifiers. A
					Class can decide which data member will be
					visible to outside
					world and which is not.
					<br>
					<b>Abstraction in Header files:</b> One
					more type of abstraction in Java can be
					header files. For example, consider the
					pow() method present in math.h header file.
					Whenever we need to calculate power of a
					number, we simply call the
					function pow() present in the math.h header
					file and pass the numbers as arguments
					without knowing the underlying algorithm
					according to which the function is actually
					calculating power of numbers.
					<br><br><b>Advantages of Data Abstraction:

					</b><br> 1. Helps the user to avoid writing
					the low level code.<br> 2. Avoids code
					duplication and increases reusability.<br>
					3. Can change internal implementation of
					class independently without
					affecting the user.<br> 4. Helps to
					increase security of an application or program
					as only important details are
					provided to the user.

					Encapsulation
				</header>
				<p>
					In normal terms Encapsulation is defined
					as wrapping up of data and information
					under a single unit. In Object Oriented
					Programming, Encapsulation is defined as
					binding together the data and the functions
					that manipulates them.
				</p>

				<p>
					Encapsulation also lead to data abstraction
					or hiding. As using encapsulation also hides
					the data. In the above example the data of
					any of the section like sales, finance or
					accounts is hidden from any other section.<br>
